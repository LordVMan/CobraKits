CobraKits Changelog!
=12/24/2012= Beta .75
-Made compatible with CraftBukkit 1.4.6

=12/15/2012= Beta .7
-Added a config file to the plugin!
  -Settings include: enable/disable cooldowns and setting their duration, forcing silent or concat on at all times.
  -All settings can be set ingame with the new /ckitcfg command.
-A few new features have been added!
  -Cooldowns: If set, player's will be forced to wait between uses of the /ckit command.
  -Concatenate: If used, the kit will be ADDED to the player's inventory instead of replacing it.
  -Per Kit Permissions: Added support for cobrakits.[kitname] permissions.
    -WARNING: giving a user cobrakits.use or .useall permissions will override this!
  -New argument parsing allows the -s(-silent) and -c(-concat) flags to be set in any order with the kit give commands.
-/ckitcfg
  -New command to control configuration functions
  -Requires the cobrakits.* permission
  -Has commands to toggle all true/false config fields, and provide the cooldown duration

=11/30/2012= Beta .6
-Lots of code rewriting! Mostly organization and efficiency changes.
-Added ability for admins to rename kits. /ckit update [oldname] [newname]
	-Does not change kit contents, just the name.
	-Permissions are included in the cobrakits.* permission.
	-Allows Admins to create generic kits with no username key. Warning: these take precedence over user kits!
-No longer forces kits to lowercase. Old kits will still work by using full name for those with useall perms.
	-Admins will need to rename old kits to case sensitive syntax, or give kit to user and allow them to save under new name.
-Integrated cobrakits.list/listall permissions into the use/useall permission for simplicity.
-Added the ability to give kits to other players in-game or through the console.
	-New command syntax is /ckit [username] [kitname], cobrakits.give is the permission.
	-To facilitate role-play servers, added optional "-silent" flag to not notify the player.
	-eg: /ckit You My:Kit -silent
	-Also now works fine with CommandBlocks! /ckit @p [kitname]

=11/27/2012= Beta .5
