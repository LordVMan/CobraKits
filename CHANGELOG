===10/29/2013 Release 1.1
*"Ghost" Item Issue
	**Should no longer be saving "ghost" items to kits.	
	**Any existing kits with ghost items should be fixed on plugin loading.
	**Also resolved issue with null kits being saved.
*Cost Flag Update
	**Now requires a Material name be provided instead of itemID per future API changes.
	**As the cost is stored as an ItemStack, no changes to existing kits are needed.
	**Added link to list of Materials to help sections for /ckit & /ukit.
*Potion Effect Changes
	**Effect durations over 8 minutes long will now be preserved and not reduced to 8 minutes.
		***This includes "infinite" effects over 1638 seconds long.
		***Note that the effect duration is saved at kit creation/update, and must be over those limits when saved to be effective.
	**Custom effect amplifiers will also now be preserved.
	**Potions will now concatenate with other potion effects if the -c/concat flag is specified with /kit.
*Cooldown Revamp
	**Cooldowns are now stored/processed in seconds instead of ticks.
		***Only config.yml should need to be updated if you use the global cooldown.
	**Now persistent and will continue through logout & restart.
	**They are stored in cooldowns.yml.
	**When running /kit while on cooldown, it will display the remaining cooldown time to the player, not the total cooldown time.
*Kit name are now case-insensitive.
*Updater!
	**CobraKits now has a built in updater that is enabled by default.
	**Can be toggled off/on by running /ckits updater or by changing the config.yml value.
	**Update is not automatic, but it will check on plugin load for new versions.
	**Users with cobrakits.* permission will receive a message if an update is available.
	**To initiate an update run /ckits update.

*Tons of behind-the-scenes code improvements :D
===5/7/2013 Beta .8
*Compatibility update for 1.5.2!
===3/20/2013 Beta .8
*Compatibility update for 1.5.1!
===3/20/2013 Beta .8
*Now compatible with 1.5 Development Build
===2/19/2013 Beta .8
*Now compatible fully with 1.4.7!
*Completely revamped command structure to use shorthand commands!
	**/ckits - Used for config display and changes. To view/change config requires cobrakits.* permission.
		*** /ckits will display usage info, while /ckits help will provide help for the below commands.
	**/ckit - Repurposed to the create command. Still requires the same cobrakits.create permission.
	**/kit - Now the command to use or give a kit. Still uses cobrakits.use/useall/give permission for those actions.
		*** The Give syntax (/kit [kitname] [username]) is now available to the console to give kits to players.
		***!Important Note!* the Give syntax is now /kit [kitname] [username] and not the reverse as it had been previously.
	**/lkit or /kits - Lists the kits available to the use. No separate permission node, linked to /kit permissions.
	**/ukit - Replaces the update command, allows you to change a kit's contents or rename it. Requires cobrakits.update/updateall permission.
		* Now able to rename any kit with .updateall permission node, and rename ability is now available via the console!
	**/dkit - The new delete kit command! Uses the same permission nodes, cobrakits.delete/deleteall.
*Global Kits
	**Formerly referred to as "generic" kits that had to be renamed to use, they are now "Global" kits while player kits are "Personal" kits.
	**You can rename any Personal kit to a Global kit with /ukit, as before.
	**Or, you can now create it with /ckit by specifing the -g -global flag if you have cobrakits.createall permissions.
	**Player's can make kits with the same name as Global kits. Their Personal kit will supercede it unless the -g/global flag is used with /kit.
*Cooldowns! Since .7 the cooldown was global due to bad coding on my part, but now it is per-user as intended.
	**New permission node added: cobrakits.cooldown.bypass, does exactly what you think.
*Kit List Pages
	**Previously, large amounts of kits could clutter up your entire screen D:
	**Sorted the list, so now global kits will appear at the top, followed by Personal kits.
	**The kit list now only displays 8 records per page (10 lines total, filling up the chat window). Simply /kit # to go to that page!
*First logon kits as requested!
	**Requires a Global kit to be set up, can use any name.
	**The field "startkit" has been added to the config.yml file.
	**Configurable in-game with /ckits startkit [kitname] command.
	**Clear the field in config.yml or enter the command without a kitname to disable the feature.
*Kit signs! Don't want your playerbase using the kit commands? This is for you!
	**Two new permissions added: cobrakits.sign.create, cobrakits.sign.use.
	**Create a sign with the first line either [COBRAKIT] or [KIT] (capitalization does not matter).
	**On the 3rd line add a valid Global kitname, it *must* be a Global kit..
		*** Note: The kit sign *requires* a Global kit to operate!
	**The 4th line is for options, specify c for -c/concat and/or s for -s/silent just like the /kit command.
	**Save the sign! If you have permissions and the kitname was correct, the following will occur:
		*** The top like will bold and red.
		*** The kitname will become blue.
		*** The 4th line will display c|s labelling active options in gold!
	**Those w/o permissions, or entering a bad kitname, will result in a blank sign and error message.
	**Any user with the .sign.use permission can access the kit signs. They are subject to the same cooldown as the /kit command!
*Other changes and resolved issues.
	**Added clearing of potion and other affects upon receiving a kit.
	**Player's with .useall/.deleteall but not .use/.delete could not use/delete their own kits, this is resolved :D
	**Lots of other stuff I can't all remember D:

===12/24/2012 Beta .75
*Made compatible with CraftBukkit 1.4.6

===12/15/2012 Beta .7
*Added a config file to the plugin!
  **Settings include: enable/disable cooldowns and setting their duration, forcing silent or concat on at all times.
  **All settings can be set ingame with the new /ckitcfg command.
*A few new features have been added!
  *Cooldowns: If set, player's will be forced to wait between uses of the /ckit command.
  *Concatenate: If used, the kit will be ADDED to the player's inventory instead of replacing it.
  *Per Kit Permissions: Added support for cobrakits.[kitname] permissions.
    **WARNING: giving a user cobrakits.use or .useall permissions will override this!
  *New argument parsing allows the -s(-silent) and -c(-concat) flags to be set in any order with the kit give commands.
*/ckitcfg
  **New command to control configuration functions
  **Requires the cobrakits.* permission
  **Has commands to toggle all true/false config fields, and provide the cooldown duration

===11/30/2012 Beta .6
*Lots of code rewriting! Mostly organization and efficiency changes.
*Added ability for admins to rename kits. /ckit update [oldname] [newname]
	**Does not change kit contents, just the name.
	**Permissions are included in the cobrakits.* permission.
	**Allows Admins to create generic kits with no username key. Warning: these take precedence over user kits!
*No longer forces kits to lowercase. Old kits will still work by using full name for those with useall perms.
	**Admins will need to rename old kits to case sensitive syntax, or give kit to user and allow them to save under new name.
*Integrated cobrakits.list/listall permissions into the use/useall permission for simplicity.
*Added the ability to give kits to other players in-game or through the console.
	*New command syntax is /ckit [username] [kitname], cobrakits.give is the permission.
	*To facilitate role-play servers, added optional "-silent" flag to not notify the player.
	*eg: /ckit You My:Kit -silent
	*Also now works fine with CommandBlocks! /ckit @p [kitname]

===11/27/2012 Beta .5
*Gone from nothing to something!
